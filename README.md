This PoC is related to the integration of ChatGPT into a GitHub repository through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Actually there's no way to allow ChatGPT access a GitHub repository, inclusing the Pull Request permormed in any repository branch.

## Design

We will obtain this integration thanks to GitHub actions. This repository contains an Action that performs the following tasks.

* Pull Request checking and analizing, providing comments abou the repo.
